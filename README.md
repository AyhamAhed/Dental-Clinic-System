# Dental-Clinic-System
In my database course, I co-developed a patient management system dental clinic using Java, JavaFX and MySql. This application streamlines patient reservations, payments, and appointment scheduling. Designed with a user-friendly interface, it facilitates a smooth experience for both patients and staff. The well-structured code ensures efficient operation with respect to time and space complexity.
